**Positive Development**

This project is focused on visualizing the social network of community organizations focused on positive youth development within the Northern Colorado region. By visualizing the network we will see what organizations collaborate with one another. After viewing the community partner collaborative network, we will intervent to insight more collaboration so there we can help to encourage resource sharing. 
After we intervene, we hope to collect the social network data again to see the effectiveness of the intervention. Therefore, this project incorporates a longitudinal component. Please send any comments or questions to <ndyetz@gmail.com>.

Here is a screenshot of our rough draft network. Next, I plan to clean it up and color each node.
