**Positive Development**

This project is focused on visualizing the social network of community organizations focused on positive youth development within the Northern Colorado region. By visualizing the network, we will see what youth development organizations collaborate with one another within in the Northern Colorado region. After viewing the community partner collaborative network, we will intervene and insight more collaboration. The goal help to encourage resource sharing among community partners. 

After we intervene, we hope to collect the social network data again to see the effectiveness of the intervention. Therefore, this project incorporates a longitudinal component. Please send any comments or questions to <ndyetz@gmail.com>.
