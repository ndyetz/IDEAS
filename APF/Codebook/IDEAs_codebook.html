<p><strong>List of Items in Instrument</strong><br />
In the course of our lives, negative things may occur because of our own actions, the actions of others, or circumstances beyond our control. For some time after these events, we may have negative thoughts or feelings about ourselves, others, or the situation. Think about how you typically respond to such negative events. Next to each of the following items write the number (from the 7-point scale below) that best describes how you typically respond to the type of negative situation described. There are no right or wrong answers. Please be as open as possible in your answers.</p>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Scores for items 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, &amp; 18 are the same as the answer written by the person taking the HFS. Scores for items 2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 are reversed.

<li>To calculate the Total HFS, HFS Forgivenesss of Self, HFS Forgiveness of Others, and HFS Forgiveness of Situations, sum the values for the items that compose each scale or subscale (with appropriate items being reverse scored).
