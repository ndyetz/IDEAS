# A Promising Future

[A Promising Future](http://apromisingfuture.com/) (APF) makes an intentional investment to place young lives on a path of promise. We do what is known as positive youth development.

Through our relationship education workshops, curriculum, and speakers, we build on the strengths of emerging adults so they can develop skills for success in life. The ripple effects can empower not only this generation, but also generations to come.

Our program was established in 2001 as a proactive outreach of Alternatives Pregnancy Center. At Alternatives, we've seen firsthand the pain of unintended consequences that come with uninformed choices. We had to do something positive-something that would encourage young people to discover the keys to whole-person health.

Today, we provide resources and training for teachers, counselors, caseworkers, pastors, and anyone passionate about the potential of today's youth to discover A Promising Future.
